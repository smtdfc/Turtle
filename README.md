# ðŸ›‘ Announcement: Discontinuation of Turtle Development and Ecosystem

Dear Community,

After many years of development and support, we regret to announce that **Turtle will officially cease development from version 3**. This applies to all related ecosystems as well.

## ðŸŽ¯ Reason for Transition
Instead of continuing Turtleâ€™s development, we have decided to focus our efforts on **Rumious** â€“ a new platform with significant improvements in performance, and better support for modern technologies. Rumious is built from the lessons learned from Turtle, bringing a better experience for users.

## ðŸš€ What's Next?
- **Turtle v3 will be the final release**, and no further updates or official support will be provided.
- **Rumious will completely replace Turtle**, and we encourage everyone to transition to this new platform.
- **Migration documentation and tools** will be available soon to help make the switch from Turtle to Rumious smoother.

## ðŸ’¡ Moving Forward Together
We understand that this is a significant change, but we believe that Rumious will bring much greater value. Join us on this journey!

Thank you for your continued support throughout the years!

_Sincerely,  
The Development Team_
